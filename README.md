# Homework 1: Code Refactor

## Description

For this homework in Week 1, we were assigned to refactor the HTML and the CSS code to meet accessibility standards, use of semantic HTML elements, and structuring/ordering in both HTML and CSS. 

My motivation was clear when I first saw the code, **it's messy.** I strived to simplify and structure the code as we were taught and as I have seen over the week in terms of seeing code and knowing exactly where, what, and why it does what it does. 

The main issue to begin with was related to the accessibilty standards. If I were to be blind and use a screen reader to 'view' the page, it would've made my head spin. Luckily, I was able to make the changes and edits using semantic elements in the HTML, and combining similar code and removing any irrelevant code in the CSS, that I believe are to meet the standards. 

I've learned that structuring is a huge part of coding in whatever language you're using, and the right elements can make a big difference. 

I've included the **User Story** and the **Acceptance Criteria** for reference:

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Installation
1. If you're reading this README, then you most likely already have access to my Github Repo, but I'll include a link for reference containing the index.html, and the assets folder: [Jason's Github Repo for HW-1: Code Refactor](https://github.com/jasonchun7/hw-1-code-refactor)

2. The actual website from the assignment (up to date): [Horiseon/Marketing Page](https://jasonchun7.github.io/hw-1-code-refactor/)

## Credits

For this assignment, I didn't have any classmates or other collaborators to assist me. I wanted to solve and structure the code by myself as it helps me learn better. I did although go back to previous HTML and CSS files from classwork that I referenced in terms of the elements used and the structuring.
